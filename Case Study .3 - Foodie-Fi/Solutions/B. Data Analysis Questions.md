where plan_name = 'trial' 
GROUP BY MONTH(s.start_date);
```

   from foodie_fi.plans p
   join foodie_fi.subscriptions s 
   on p.plan_id = s.plan_id )
   
   select count(*) as churn_after_trial ,
         100*count(*) / count(distinct customer_id) as percentage 
	from nextplan
    where plan_name = 'trial'  and next_plan = 'churn';
```
