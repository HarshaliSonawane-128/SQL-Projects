## Overview about  Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar (glucose) levels. 
Glucose is a crucial source of energy for cells, and its levels in the bloodstream are tightly controlled by the hormone insulin, which is produced by the pancreas.

There are two main types of diabetes:

- Type 1 Diabetes
- Type 2 Diabetes

## Project Task :
- Investigate the usage and effectiveness of diabetes medications among patients.
- Explore correlations between specific medications and improvements in blood glucose control.

## Business Questions
1. Retrieve the Patient_id and ages of all patients.
2. Select all female patients who are older than 40.
3. Calculate the average BMI of patients.
4. List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.
5. Find patients who have hypertension and diabetes.
6. Determine the number of patients with heart disease.
7. Group patients by smoking history and count how many smokers and nonsmokers there are.
8. Retrieve the Patient_ids of patients who have a BMI greater than the average BMI.
9. Find the patient with the highest HbA1c level and the patient with the lowest HbA1clevel.
10. Calculate the age of patients in years (assuming the current date as of now).
11. Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group.
12. Update the smoking history of patients who are older than 50 to "Ex-smoker."
13. Insert a new patient into the database with sample data.
14. Delete all patients with heart disease from the database.
15. Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator . 2 of 2
16. Define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure its values are unique.
17. Create a view that displays the Patient_ids, ages, and BMI of patients.
18. Suggest improvements in the database schema to reduce data redundancy and
improve data integrity.[ Answer ](https://github.com/HarshaliSonawane-128/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Diabetes%20%20Data%20Analysis%20Project/Document%20of%20Data%20Analysis.pdf)
