         sum( case when txn_type = 'deposit' then 1 else 0 end) as deposite_count ,
         sum( case when txn_type = 'purchase' then 1 else 0 end ) as purches_count ,
		sum( case when txn_type = 'withdrawal' then 1 else 0 end ) as withdrawal_count 
  from data_bank.customer_transactions
  group by customer_id , month(txn_date) ) 
  
  select months , count(customer_id) as customer_count
  from cte_transaction 
  where deposite_count > 1 and  (purches_count = 1 or withdrawal_count =1 ) 
  group by months;
  ```
